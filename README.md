# google-maps-experiments

This repo will contain the code for the various experiments being done with the API of Google Maps, in order to provide the geo-centric functionality needed for Project Echo.

The repo will eventually include branches for:

- functionality for user entered coordinate
- elevation detection
- distance calculation
- travel directions
- exporting of location data to a weather API
